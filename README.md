This repository demonstrates a common race condition bug in VHDL and its solution.  The bug arises from assigning a signal within a clocked process that might change before the clock edge is completely processed, leading to unexpected results. The solution introduces a temporary variable to hold the value of data_in, ensuring correct assignment regardless of changes after the rising edge.
